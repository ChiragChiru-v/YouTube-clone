# YouTube-clone

This project is a static replica of the YouTube homepage, built using only HTML and CSS. The goal of the project was to practice fundamental HTML concepts and CSS styling techniques while emulating the design and layout of YouTube. Though this version does not include dynamic functionality (like video playback or user interaction), it focuses on structure, layout, and aesthetics.
